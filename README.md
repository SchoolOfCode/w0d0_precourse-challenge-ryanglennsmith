### This is not the greatest webpage in the world...

## This is a _tribute_

This is a response to the first project in the Free Code Camp responsive web design tutorials.

A tribute to Captain Ahab. Everyone's favorite monomaniacal whaling boat skipper. _Moby Dick_. Great American Novel. Since it's in the public domain, no copyright concerns to use text from it.

I worked through FCC's web design and basic javascript courses earlier this year (before even having heard of or applying to School of Code). So I have a little bit of a head start in that, but what _is_ new is writing this README in markdown and pushing all this stuff onto GitHub. The basic usefulness of git is rather easy to understand, but since I have only been working on coding entirely on my own, I have still just relied upon the old college term paper technique of **document_xyz_december_03_tweaked_FINAL_onemoretweak_REALLY_FINAL_THIS_TIME.docx**

Time to grow out of that! I'm excited to get started at School of Code.
