          He’s a queer man, Captain Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh,
          thou’lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly,
          god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn’t speak much; but, when he does
          speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s above
          the common; Ahab’s been in colleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals;
          been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in
          mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and
          the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no,
          and he ain’t Captain Peleg; he’s Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old, thou
          knowest, was a crowned king!”

          He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has
          overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking
          away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole
          high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
          unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out
          from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
          tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you
          saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that
          perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a
          great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
          without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from
          top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still
          greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or
          whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could
          certainly say.

          <blockquote>
            Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.
